# flight_visualizer

Just some data analysis and visualization for flights taken. 

I used https://www.distancecalculator.net/ to get distance between cities, and https://www.latlong.net/ to get GPS coordinates.

The chart is done with pivot tables in Google Sheets. The heatmap is made using Python with libraries: pandas, folium, collections, branca, numpy.
